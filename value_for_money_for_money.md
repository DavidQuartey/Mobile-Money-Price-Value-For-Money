# Mobile Money Interoperability and the least costly way to make Mobile Money transfers

On 10^th^ May 2018, Mobile Money Interoperability was officially [launched](https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2018/May-10th/bawumia-launches-mobile-money-payment-interoperability-system.php) in Ghana. This means that you can now transfer mobile money across networks at a fee.

I wrote part of this piece a few days after the launch because interoperability brought up some interesting questions for me. Since then, significant things have happened within the space which meant I've had to rewrite some portions. Transactions have gone from close to [3000](https://citinewsroom.com/2018/05/15/mobile-money-interoperability-scored-3000-transactions-on-first-day-ghipss/) on the first day to [800, 000 transactions/month](https://www.modernghana.com/news/882509/mobile-money-interoperability-hits-800000-transactions-re.html) by August. Most importantly though, since then [AirtelTigo merged](http://www.airteltigo.com.gh/airteltigo-outlines-plans-for-mobile-financial-service-sector/) their mobile money platform.

Some interesting questions this brought up for me at the time include, if a mobile money user wants to make a transaction, after factoring in cash in fees (if any), transfer fees, and the cash out fees, what is the final amount withdrawn? Or put another way, what 2 combination of networks allows the receiver to cash out at minimum cost in terms of fees? 

Given that mobile money users can switch to any network since the market is not fragmented anymore, how competitive are Interoperable transaction options to same network transactions? 

What does interoperability mean for low income people who typically send small amounts?

I find out this and more in this article.

Lets start off with this chart.

To read the chart above, Vodafone Cash to MTN Momo for example combines the transfer fee of making a transfer from Vodafone Cash to MTN Momo and the cash out fee of MTN Momo at a particular amount. This gives a sense of how much it costs for that particular network combination. 

With the introduction of interoperability, this analysis extends this to all possible network combinations to compare amounts to see what it means for users in fees terms.

At GHc10 for instance, interoperability has provided a comparatively cheap alternative (Vodafone Cash to either AirtelTigo Money or MTN Momo) of sending such a low amount at GHC1 considering the fact that previously exactly the same amount through the voucher system would have likely cost more.

Either way, one thing that strikes me is how fees alternate. Either you pay GHc1 or GHc1.25.

Is it the same at larger amounts?

Suddenly, things look a little... different. An incredible 0.5% of GHc 1000 is paid in fees when using AirtelTigo to AirtelTigo (seems like they're using Tigo's Cash rates after the Airtel / Tigo merger for same network transfers).

Just so we see how over a period these fees divergerces, lets looks at this scenario: Imagine a mobile money user has to transfer GHC1000 to a friend ones every month for the next 12months. Imagine whatever combination she uses is consistent across the 12months, how much different will the total amount of fees be by the 12th month?

It's incredible isn't it? 

She'd have paid between GHc60 to GHc300 in fees after sending GHc12, 000 to her friend over the 12 months period using mobile money on her phone.

Previously, no token or voucher transfer would have been more cost effective than a same network transfer but thats not true anymore.

Even users of the current market leader (MTN) are now better-off interoperating to AirtelTigo than on same network transfer basis for larger amounts.

However, based purely on other possible network combinations a mobile money user may consider, interoprability has also provided relatively costly alternatives too. As high as GHc25 (2.5% paid in fees in percentage terms). 

Still, it's likely that the pre-interoperability rate for say MTN Momo to an unregistered user would've been 5% (GHc50), compared to the interoperable rate averaging at about 1.9% (GHc19) with the added benefit and convenience of direct transfer into a cross network wallet.

# Are Mobile Money fees retrogressive in structure?

(Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA))[https://www.poverty-action.org] recently came out with a [study](http://www.cgap.org/blog/how-do-mobile-money-fee-structures-impact-poor) which highlighted the fees paid (cash in and cash out) on 21 mobile money service across 7 countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and India). Even though Ghana was not included in their work, they concluded that majority had prices which were regressive in **structure** because "the larger a consumers transaction, the less they pay in **percentage terms**" (emphasis mine).

I was curious to know how this translates to Ghana's Telco mobile money prices in terms of structure.

Considering each network combination and their transfer + cash out fees, mobile money products in Ghana are regressive in structure too. This shows with the general downward trend of the average fees paid as the amount increases. This means that at lower amounts, users are paying more in fees in percentage terms compared to higher amounts. This is important because, low income people will most likely send low amounts and so, they will most likely be paying paying in percentage terms compared to people who send higher amounts.

Looking at how Telco's in Ghana structure their mobile money prices, the higher fees may be as a result of how amounts within the 1 - 50 range are charged flat rates. Currently, all 3 Telco's in Ghana who provide this service charge flat rates for the GHc1-GHc50 band. As noted, this way of pricing has its benefits because (LINK) a flat rate makes it easy for people with low numeracy skills to understand how much they are charged, so it has its benefits too. However, it ends up being a lot in percentage terms at such low amounts.

"If you are sending more go for AirtelTigo, but if it's less it doesn't matter where" To illustrate this,.. lets assume...
